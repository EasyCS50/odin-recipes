    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Coarse salt and ground pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>¼ cup plain dried breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes in puree</li>
        <li>¾ pound spaghetti</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Set a large pot of salted water to boil. In a bowl, combine Parmesan, 
            parsley, garlic, egg, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add beef and 
            breadcrumbs; mix gently. Form into 16 balls.</li>
        <li>In a 5-quart Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat oil over medium. Add meatballs, 
            and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 
            tomatoes; bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer; cover partially, and cook, 
            stirring occasionally, until meatballs are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta until al dente. Drain, and return to pot; add meatballs 
            and sauce, and toss gently. Serve with Parmesan.</li>
